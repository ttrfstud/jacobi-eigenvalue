jacobi eigenvalue algorithm
===========================
jae is implemented as described [here](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~klounici6/2605/Lectures%20notes%20Carlen/chap3.pdf). the signature of the only exported method is _(matrix, threshold)_. it would not examine the parameters for correctness, so check them yourself. threshold should be > 0. as it would internally calculate the number of iterations for given threshold and it would do ln(threshold), do not supply 0 as threshold - you _can_ get infinite loop.
